- Previous exams based in CSV files.
- 208 prescriptions based in each diagnosed as suggested automatic outputs, possible to erase or editing and even consults the several methods of TCM (shu-points, mu-points, specified shens and 13 texts and diagrams of use as consult support).
- Native integrated diagnoses in TCM as current’s World Health Organization new ICD-11 (new worldwide catalog).
- Possible of analysis based in cun-guan-chi types, 28 types of pulses, thongs color, dimensions, moviments, warmith and humidity states, as also skin, pain, eyes analysis and Huang di’s Nei jing methods of cunkou-renyng differencial methods.
- Detection of suggestion of recommendations of mu, sun si miao’s ghosts’ points, shu and chronoacupuncture based in shi tian gan’s local time method, liu xie, ni’s pathologies, star and windows of heaven points, luo, ho, xi, yuan, muxi and all wonderful vases indications as possible automatic marks.
- Multi-selection of treatments and editable accuponts automatic prescriptions and running of smart algorithm that prevents dozens of needles, adapting for best mean marge.
- Suggestion of Chinease and Japanese extrameridian’s uses and action base and location alike.
- Use of IDs for privacity of pacients name and data.
- Local data storage allowing mobility for clouding porpouses.
