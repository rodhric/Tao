## ABOUT LOGGING ACCESS NUMBERS

TAO IS PROGRAMMED FOR MANDATORY USE OF CPF FOR ID LOG, THERE IS A SHREWD ALGORITHM FOR IT'S USE AND NOT USED IN USA, FOR TESTING USE THE LINK IN FOOTER OF ITEM

- What is a Brazilian CPF?
A CPF is an individual taxpayer identification number given to people living in Brazil, both native Brazilians and resident aliens, who pay taxes. The CPF number is an identification number of Brazilian citizens emitted by the Brazilian Ministry of Revenue, which is called "Ministério da Fazenda".
- What does CPF stand for?
CPF stands for Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (Natural Persons Register). Native Brazilians can request a CPF at any time in their lives - parents will often apply on behalf of their children when they are newborns, as CPFs are vital to living in Brazil and it’s best to obtain one sooner rather than later.
- A CPF is 11 digits long, comprised of nine base digits, and two digits at the end that are the result of an arithmetic operation on the first nine numbers, meaning any typing mistakes will lead to an invalid number. Here is an example of a CPF: 231.002.999-00.
- The CPF is comprised of a base of 9 digits and 2 check digits. It is usually written like '231.002.999-00' so as to be more human-readable.

This module provides test_cpf for checking that a CPF number is correct. Here a correct CPF number means
it is 11 digits long
it satisfies the two check equations mentioned below
Before checking, any non-digit letter is stripped, making it easy to test formatted entries like '231.002.999-00' and entries with extra blanks like ' 999.221.222-00 '.

test_cpf
test_cpf('999.444.333-55') # incorrect CPF, returns 0
test_cpf(' 263.946.533-30 ') # is ok, returns 1
test_cpf('888') # nope, returns undef
Tests whether a CPF number is correct. Before testing, any non-digit character is stripped. Then it is expected to be 11 digits long and to satisfy two check equations which validate the last two check digits. See "THE CHECK EQUATIONS".
The policy to get rid of '.' and '-' is very liberal. It indeeds discards anything that is not a digit (0, 1, ..., 9) or letter. That is handy for discarding spaces as well
test_cpf(' 263.946.533-30 ') # is ok, returns 1
But extraneous inputs like '#333%444*2.3+2-00' are also accepted. If you are worried about this kind of input, just check against a regex:
warn "bad CPF: only digits (11) expected"
  unless ($cpf =~ /^\d{11}$/);
warn "bad CPF: does not match mask '___.___.___-__'"
  unless ($cpf =~ /^\d{3}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}-\d{2}$/);
NOTE. Integer numbers like 9999811299 (or 99_998_112_99) with fewer than 11 digits will be normalized (eg. to "09999811299") before testing.
canon_cpf
canon_cpf(99); # returns '00000000099'
canon_cpf('999.999.999-99'); # returns '99999999999'
Brings a candidate for a CPF number to a canonical form. In case, the argument is an integer, it is formatted to at least eleven digits. Otherwise, it is stripped of any non-alphanumeric characters and returned as it is.
format_cpf
format_cpf('00000000000'); # returns '000.000.000-00'
Formats its input into '000.000.000-00' mask. First, the argument is canon'ed and then dots and hyphen are added to the first 11 digits of the result.
parse_cpf
($base, $dv) = parse_cpf($cpf);
$hashref = parse_cpf('999.222.111-00'); # { base => '999222111', dv => '00' }
Splits a candidate for CPF number into base and check digits (dv - dígitos de verificação). It canon's the argument before splitting it into 9- and 2-digits parts. In a list context, returns a two-element list with the base and the check digits. In a scalar context, returns a hash ref with keys 'base' and 'dv' and associated values.
random_cpf
$rand_cpf = random_cpf($valid);
$correct_cpf = random_cpf();
$cpf = random_cpf(1); # also a correct CPF
$bad_cpf = random_cpf(0); # an incorrect CPF
Generates a random CPF. If $valid is omitted or 1, it is guaranteed to be correct. If $valid is 0, it is guaranteed to be incorrect. This function is intented for mass test. (Use it wisely.)
The implementation is simple: just generate a 9-digits random number, hopefully with a uniform distribution and then compute the check digits. If $valid==0, the check digits are computed not to satisfy the check equations.


THE CHECK EQUATIONS
A correct CPF number has two check digits which are computed from the base 9 first digits. Consider the CPF number written as 11 digits
c[1] c[2] c[3] c[4] c[5] c[6] c[7] c[8] c[9] dv[1] dv[2]
To check whether a CPF is correct or not, it has to satisfy the check equations:
c[1]*10+c[2]*9+c[3]*8+c[4]*7+c[5]*6+
        c[6]*5+c[7]*4+c[8]*3+c[9]*2+dv[1] = 0 (mod 11) or
                                          = 1 (mod 11) (if dv[1]=0)
and
c[2]*10+c[3]*9+c[4]*8+c[5]*7+c[6]*6+
        c[7]*5+c[8]*4+c[9]*3+dv[1]*2+dv[2] = 0 (mod 11) or
                                           = 1 (mod 11) (if dv[2]=0)
